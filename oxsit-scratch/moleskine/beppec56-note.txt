=========
The idea of preparing a new interface in OOo proved to be unfruitful
so, last commit with the work carried out so far, then back to a more std implementation
using std OOo interface types

idl compiled ok, regmerge didn't complain, XTypeProvider on DocumentSignatures service obj showed
the interface but UnoRuntime.queryinterface didn't return it.
Making the whole idea not useful.

====
To list type in OOo:

./regview /home/beppe/ooo-b/ooo3.0.1-pristine-bin/openoffice.org/ure/share/misc/types.rdb / |less
./regview <ooo installation dir>/openoffice.org/ure/share/misc/types.rdb / |less
