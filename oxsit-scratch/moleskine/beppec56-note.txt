Started work on the new stuff needed to describes the XAdES signature state in the
document.

Big work. New UNO interfaces needed, other major work to do.

Obviously the new stuff is in a state of great fluctuation...

============

I finally succeeded in adding a new interface in UNO.
I needed a dedicated Java jar library containing the new .class file generated through the
OOo SDK procedure to generate new types in Java:

1) descrive the new element using UNO IDL language
2) compile the new definition with idlc from ooo_sdk
3) prepare the .rdb file containing the UNO registration information
4) use javamaker to generated the new class declaring the interface
5) build a jar Java archive containing the .class file so generated
6) when installing the extension install both file, the .rdb AND the .jar.

Now I need to clean up the part I touched to implement this...

When I had time, I'll change the way the procedure described above is done,
currently carried out through console and in Linux only.
Possibly using ant as a make command for the whole process.

The Windows environment needs to be checked as well.

=========
The idea of preparing a new interface in OOo proved to be unfruitful
so, last commit with the work carried out so far, then back to a more std implementation
using std OOo interface types

idl compiled ok, regmerge didn't complain, XTypeProvider on DocumentSignatures service obj showed
the interface but UnoRuntime.queryinterface didn't return it.
Making the whole idea not useful.

====
To list type in OOo:

./regview /home/beppe/ooo-b/ooo3.0.1-pristine-bin/openoffice.org/ure/share/misc/types.rdb / |less
./regview <ooo installation dir>/openoffice.org/ure/share/misc/types.rdb / |less
