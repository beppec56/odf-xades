Usage examples.<br>
In the {@link it.trento.comune.j4sign.examples.CLITest} class you find a complete demonstration of the 
Smart card signature - CMS encapsulation - CMS verification process in a command line application.
This can be easily transformed in a Swing GUI standalone application.
<p>
The combined use of {@link it.trento.comune.j4sign.examples.CMSServlet} and {@link it.trento.comune.j4sign.examples.SimpleSignApplet} 
shows j4sign running in a web application environment, taking advantage of the splitted signing - CMS encapsulation
approach.<br>Signature is done in the lightwheight <code>SimpleSignApplet</code>, whether CMS message
build and verification are done on the server by <code>CMSServlet</code>.
<p>
The examples are designed for permitting testing and debugging from inside an IDE 
(we used <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>).
