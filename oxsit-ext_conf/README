To build
========

You need ant (http://ant.apache.org) installed and a java compiler Java 1.5 is suggested.
Used ant 1.7.0 for testing.

You need an OpenOffice.org installed, and an optional OpenOffice.org SDK.

Edit the file build.xml in this root directory of the distribution and edit the
value of properties 'ooosdk' and 'ooo_classes_path' to suit your installation.

ooosdk is needed to include the start-up code. 

If the ooosdk is not present, ...

Localization
============

The string to be localized are in document localization-master.ods.
The button "Export messages" export the messages to "AddonMessages.xcu.xml" file.

The file path is fixed inside the macro. 
Please have a look at the macro (Main.Main() ) contained in the file.

The option dialog is localized using the standard dialog localization,
through basi IDE.

Building
========

The build.xml file in this directory is the main ant build file.

Running it you will be able to build the entire extension.

For details see README in doc project.

Some Details
============

The path it_plio_xades_options contains the options dialog pages
edited by Macro Dialog Editor in OOo Macro IDE.

They should be saved to extension/dialogs as single dialog, for options management.

The management of this library needs same care
As of today, 2009-04-03 ,in case you need to edit the option dialog, this library should
read in OOo in a tricky way:
1. first copy it in another place
2. then remove the .svn subdirectory that exist there
3. import into OOo into your personal basic library
4. close OOo
5. goto the  personal basic library (in Debian Linux it's something in the form of:
<home dir>/.openoffice.org/3/user/basic)
6. remove the subdirectory it_plio_ext_xades_options you find here
7. substitute it manually with the same directory you cleaned of .svn subdirectory at
point 2.

You can start to modify the dialog or add a new one.

To save the dialog use: "Export Dialog" button
